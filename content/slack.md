Join local Syracuse developers in the [Syracuse Tech
Slack](https://syracuseio.slack.com/) group.

This is a place to discuss the local development scene, seek help, share advice,
and discuss everything related to being a Software / Web / Tech person in Syracuse NY.

### What is Slack?

Slack is a chat application that simplifies communication communication between
teams and, in our case, communities of like-minded folks

Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called “channels”, and we have several
set up. When you join, you'll be automatically added to:

* `#general`: General chat & discussion
* `#intros`: Don't be shy, say hello! What do you work on?

You'll also find rooms for specific languages or topics. Check out what's happening in `#javascript` and `#vim`

### Are there rules?

I'm glad you asked.  Please be a positive member of the community and follow our general [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct)

## This group is for you if:
- You are interested in creating awesome things with technology
- You consider yourself part of the Syracuse community (whether you live nearby
  or not)
- You are kind

## This group is NOT for you if:
- Your main interest in joining has nothing to do with creating awesome things
  with technology
- You don't like [the rules](/the_rules)
- You are a spammy recruiter, who is here to spam the group

### Am I eligible to join?

In short, yes! We are really open to having as many people that want to be a
part, be a part. There are no hard rules on who is able to join and who is not.
The only consideration is that the purpose of the group is to grow local
relationships. That means if have attended meet ups in Syracuse, work for a
company based out of Syracuse, work with other developers in Syracuse, or have
some similar affiliation, join in!
