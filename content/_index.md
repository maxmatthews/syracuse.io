Welcome to Syracuse.io, home to Syracuse's diverse and growing developer scene.  

One that is based on
diversity of skill and people. There are already groups focused on all things
Javascript, learning new skills as a woman in code, sharing and working on code
together, as well as the greatest hackathon in NYS.

We have an active slack community, a monthly mailng list, and a
list of upcoming dev events.

Please check out our upcoming events below, join us in slack, say
"hello ~~world~~", and join our community of friendly local devs.

Interested in starting a new dev meetup?  Contact us on email, twitter, or slack!
