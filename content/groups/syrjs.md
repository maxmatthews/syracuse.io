We are a group dedicated to discussing and working with the JavaScript programming language.

Currently we meet the third Tuesday of each month, and each event has both a learning and
interactive portion. Whether youâ€™re an experienced JavaScript programmer or just getting started,
we welcome and encourage all proficiency levels.
