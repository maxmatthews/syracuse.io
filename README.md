# syracuse.io

This is the source code for https://syracuse.io Its goal is to build a consolidated
directory and calendar of technology user groups and meetups.

We use [hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a static site generator, and this source code
is built on, deployed to, and hosted by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

### To generate the site

1. Clone this repo
2. [Install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)
3. Run `hugo -wv`

Hugo will build the site and run a webserver so you can view it.  Visit
http://localhost:1313 to view the site.

### Adding and removing meetup groups

Please feel free to submit pull requests adding your meetup group  as
a markdown file to `content/groups`
